## Pre-knowledge

### Git

#### Git Commit
Please make sure each commit is meaningful, and commit as long as you have finished a part of your code. Commits will store the time and all diffs. Your assignment will be reviewed based on all your commits, but not your final code.

#### Git Branch
If you are implementing more than one feature at a time (or fix bugs), we recommand to use branches rather than only the master branch.
